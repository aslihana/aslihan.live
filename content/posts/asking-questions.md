You may always ask yourself `how it's made?`, `how did it happen?` or `how do I push myself to be better?` with some variants... and it may feel overwhelming.

But the most important thing I learnt from the software development phases is **`keep asking questions`** to reach a conclusion. When you feel exhausted, you must remember that this is the reminder to not give up. I don't want to sound like I'm giving `out-of-date self improvement tips`. However completing all projects is critical; the key is `not giving up on trying`. Haven't you known `how to bubble sort an array`? I'm sure you can find that answer in your first Google search. But what to do when you have a `stock management system` homework in Programming 101 class? You have nested questions to build that homework. Haven't you found the next step when building this management system? You should just keep asking differently. 

Asking questions keeps your mind awake, jogs your memory. Inquiring in various ways leads to progress because it stimulates creativity. If you ask questions, it will be harder to be defrauded. If you ask questions, you can learn through your curiosity, which is golden.Because asking questions is a form of suspicion. Like Descartes said, `If you would be a real seeker after truth, it is necessary that at least once in your life you doubt, as far as possible, all things.`

Keep asking and taking notes from their answers. Keep asking, especially in political ways, for a better life.
