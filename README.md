# My Blog Website
My thoughts will be shared on my blog. It is now hosted at https://aslihana.github.io/aslihan.live/

The website uses [hugo static website generator](https://gohugo.io/) with [Terminal](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-terminal/) theme template.

**When I'm enabling the Github Pages to host the website, it was a tragedy with too many failed commits. As a final attempt I tried Github Actions with Hugo configuration and it worked!**
